# Primefactors kata

This kata is a TDD exercise.

## Rulez of play

* No line of production code is written without a failing test being made to work.
* No more unit test code is written than strictly necessary to make a failing test work, where compile errors are also failures.
* No more production code is written than necessary to make the failing test work

The above comes down to Read, Green, Refactor. 
First make a test that fails then make production code that make the test work and than look if the code can be refactored.
Repeat the above cycle until solution is found.


## Kata

Find the prime factors of a give number.    

Write a class named “PrimeFactors” that has one method: process.
The process method takes an integer argument and returns a List<Integer>.  
That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.

* Create a project named primefactors
* Create a package named primefactors
* Create a class named PrimeFactors
* Create a unit test named PrimeFactorsTest

Google for what primefactors means if you don't know.


## tutorial

I've taged just about all the steps taken to get to the solution.

if you've cloned the repository you can step through the solution by starting with tag step_0 to step_20

e.g. `git checkout step_0` or `git checkout step_10`
